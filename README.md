Second version of Pig, this time with classes. Also includes alternate game version, Hog.

Rules:
Players take turns rolling a die. If the die is a one then their turn is over. Otherwise the value of the die is added to their pot, and they can choose to end their turn and add the pot to their overall score or can choose to keep rolling. First player to 20 wins.

In alternate version of hog, the player only rolls once per turn, but may choose how many dice they wish to roll. If any of the dice are a one, they get nothing for the turn, otherwise they get the sum of the dice.

To play: ruby game_player.rb
